Welcome to the SiAC project. This project was developed back in 2011. I developed the system using JSF + plain Javascript + Hibernate + MySQL.

Its purpose was to help automate the process of evaluation between employees of a corporation that I worked for.

I tried to make the directories name self-explanatory but I'll list a brief description here of what each of them contains:

* _dev_docs_: the documentation generated for development purposes. It includes files such as the questionnaire used to elicit the requirements, the vision document, class diagrams, etc.

* _eclipse_arquive_: the src files of the system exported from eclipse. 

* _manuals_: the documentation generated for the users of the system.

* _sql_: the SQL script file to created and populate the database for demo purposes.

* _war_: a war file generated from Eclipse to deploy the SiAC in the server (database username and password must be configured properly in the src/hibernate.cfg and tomcat server.xml files).
